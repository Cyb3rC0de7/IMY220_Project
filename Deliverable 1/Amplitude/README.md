# IMY220_Project
IMY 220 Project 2024
Playlist sharing website

Due By: Thursday, 3rd November 2024

Objective:
    - Create a website that allows users to create and share playlists. Playlists are collections of songs from music
    streaming services (in this case, Spotify). Users should be able to create, share, and manage their own
    playlists.

Project Demo:
    - Wednesday, 6th November & Thursday, 7th November
    - Immersive Technology Labs (4-62)
    - Demo the functionality on the website itself. Does not matter if database works if website does not.

    - Marks will be lost:
        ● If your system does not have all the required functionality.
        ● If you use any other technology or technique that is not part of the course.
        ● If you use code that is not your own, i.e., if you use code generators or templates, you will not get
            marks for it.
    
    - You will get 0 if: 
        ● If you submit work that is not your own.
        ● If you do not upload a Dockerfile / Docker Compose file.
        ● If the Dockerfile / Docker Compose file does not run the application.
        ● If you do not upload to ClickUP.
